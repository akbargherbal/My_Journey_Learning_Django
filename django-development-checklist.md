# Django Development Checklist

## Project Setup

- [ ] Create a virtual environment
- [ ] Install Django and other required packages
- [ ] Start a new Django project
- [ ] Create necessary Django apps
- [ ] Add apps to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`

## Configuration

- [ ] Configure database settings in `settings.py`
- [ ] Set `DEBUG = True` for development
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` for production
- [ ] Set up `STATIC_URL` and `STATICFILES_DIRS`
- [ ] Configure `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` if handling user uploads

## Templates

- [ ] Create a `templates` directory in the project root
- [ ] Add `templates` directory to `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` in `settings.py`
- [ ] Create a base template (`base.html`) for inheritance
- [ ] Ensure all templates extend from `base.html`
- [ ] Use `{% load static %}` in templates that use static files

## Static Files

- [ ] Create a `static` directory in the project root
- [ ] Add `static` directory to `STATICFILES_DIRS` in `settings.py`
- [ ] Organize static files into subdirectories (css, js, images)
- [ ] Use `{% static %}` template tag to reference static files

## Models

- [ ] Define models in `models.py` for each app
- [ ] Run `makemigrations` after creating or changing models
- [ ] Apply migrations with `migrate`
- [ ] Register models in `admin.py` for admin interface access

## Views

- [ ] Create views in `views.py` for each app
- [ ] Use class-based views where appropriate
- [ ] Ensure views are passing correct context to templates
- [ ] Handle form submissions and validation in views

## URLs

- [ ] Configure main `urls.py` to include app-specific URL configurations
- [ ] Create `urls.py` in each app and define URL patterns
- [ ] Use named URL patterns for reverse lookups
- [ ] Include static/media URL patterns for development

## Forms

- [ ] Create `forms.py` for complex form handling
- [ ] Use Django's built-in form classes where possible
- [ ] Implement form validation

## Authentication

- [ ] Set up user authentication views and URLs
- [ ] Create login, logout, and registration templates
- [ ] Use `@login_required` decorator for protected views

## Testing

- [ ] Write tests for models, views, and forms
- [ ] Run tests regularly with `python manage.py test`

## Security

- [ ] Keep `SECRET_KEY` secure and out of version control
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive information
- [ ] Set `DEBUG = False` in production
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` for production

## Performance

- [ ] Use Django's caching framework where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize database queries (use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()`)
- [ ] Use pagination for long lists

## Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Set up a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Configure static file serving for production (e.g., using whitenoise)
- [ ] Set up error logging
- [ ] Create a `requirements.txt` file

## Version Control

- [ ] Initialize a Git repository
- [ ] Create a `.gitignore` file (include `venv`, `*.pyc`, `db.sqlite3`, etc.)
- [ ] Make regular commits

## Documentation

- [ ] Write docstrings for complex functions and classes
- [ ] Create a README.md file with project setup instructions

By following this checklist, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of common errors and ensure that your Django project is well-structured and follows best practices.
